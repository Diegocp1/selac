Here is a script that checks for runtimes, but it does NOT check the correctness of the result.The Q_codon_vec was
produced from the selac testing routine so you have realisic values.

files provided were "Q_codon_vec.Rda" and "ode_runtime_test.R"
\section*{ode45}
\begin{itemize}
\item Variable time RK method: 
\item hini setting for ODE solver in treeTraversalODETests.R ode() call
  \begin{itemize}
  \item deviations from expected LLik in the third decimal place
  \item  hini=0 slows the calculations on the basic tree down so much that I haven't had the patience to wait for it to stop.  
  \item hini not defined: run time 11s
  \item hini=times[2]/100: run time 15s
  \item hini=times[2]/2: run time 11s
  \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\section*{lsoda}
\begin{itemize}
\item basic tree with 6 nodes takes only 14s to run.
\item hini setting for ODE solver in treeTraversalODETests.R ode() call
  \begin{itemize}
  \item ref.phy
    \begin{itemize}
    \item hini=0: run time 15s with deviation of 0
    \item hini=times[2]/2: run time 16s with deviation at third decimal place of LLik
    \end{itemize}
  \item long.phy (same as ref.phy, but first branch length set to 12)
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Note according to what Cedric told me, this method gives the same result as the matrix exponentiation., thus the LLik should be used as the reference.
